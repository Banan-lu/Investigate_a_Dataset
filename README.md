(Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree)

Investigating the Medical Appointment Dataset , it's contains information on over 100k appointments in Brazil. 

The dataset that I have chosen 'No-show appointments' from data set option that udacity gave .. 

It was created to study what factors were useful in predicting if patients would miss thier appointments.
# Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it.

I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

# What do I need to install?
I will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- csv
# What will I learn?
After completing the project, I will:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process.
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use.
- Have practice communicating the results of your analysis.
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code.
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently.
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings.
